        <h4>Product description Apple iPhone 12</h4>
        <p>
            A14 Bionic rockets past every other smartphone chip. The Pro camera system takes low-light photography to the next level — with an even bigger jump on iPhone 12 Pro Max. And Ceramic Shield delivers four times better drop performance. Let’s see what this thing can do.
            <br><br>
            A14 Bionic:<br>
            - The only thing even close was our last chip.
            <br><br>
            - A14 Bionic is the first 5-nanometre chip in the industry, with advanced components literally atoms wide. Forty per cent more transistors rev up speeds while increasing efficiency for great battery life. And a new ISP powers Dolby Vision recording — something no pro movie camera, let alone any other phone, can do.
            <br><br>
            LiDAR technology:<br>
            - Scans the surface of Mars. And now your living room.<br>
            - NASA is using LiDAR technology for its next Mars landing. iPhone 12 Pro uses a LiDAR Scanner to measure how long it takes light to reflect back from objects. So it can create a depth map of whatever space you’re in. Because it’s ultra-fast and accurate, AR apps can now transform a room into a realistic rainforest or show you how a new sneaker will fit.
            <br><br>
            A new day for Night mode:<br>
            - Night mode comes to both the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras, and it’s better than ever at capturing incredible low-light shots. LiDAR makes Night mode portraits possible. And the Wide camera lets in 27% more light, for greater detail and sharper focus day or night.
            <br><br>
            iPhone 12 Pro:<br>
            - iPhone 12 Pro Max<br>
            - iPhone 12 Pro<br>
            - 26mm focal length<br>
            - 1.4 µm pixels<br>
            - ƒ/1.6 aperture<br>
            - 100% Focus Pixels<br>
            - 7-element lens<br>
            - OIS
            <br><br>
            Apple ProRAW. For an absurd amount of creative control:
            - ProRAW gives you all the standard RAW information, along with the Apple image pipeline data. So you can get a head start on editing, with noise reduction and multi-frame exposure adjustments already in place — and have more time to tweak colour and white balance.<br>
            <br>
            Dolby Vision recording:<br>
            - 60 times more colours. Infinitely more spectacular.<br>
            - iPhone 12 Pro jumps from 8- to 10‑bit HDR recording, capturing 700 million colours for much more lifelike video. Then it goes one better, recording in Dolby Vision — the format used by film studios. You can even edit Dolby Vision video and use AirPlay to see every last bit of the difference on the big screen.<br>
            - The Wide camera’s larger sensor brings way more detail out of the shadows. And for the first time, you can take Night mode Time‑lapse videos with a tripod to capture scenes with dramatic motion. Now even your movies can pull an all-nighter.
            <br><br>
            Super Retina XDR display An infinity pool of pixels.<br>
            - iPhone 12 Pro delivers 4G LTE speeds up to 2 Gbps, so you can download large files, upload photos and stream high-quality video faster than ever. It also has up to 32 LTE bands — the most of any smartphone — so you’ll get those faster speeds in more places around the world.5
